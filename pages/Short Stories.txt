/*Short Stories*/ are a form of short fictional narrative prose. Short
stories tend to be more concise and to the point than longer works of
fiction, such as novellas (in the modern sense of this term) and novels.
Because of their brevity, successful short stories rely on literary
devices such as character, plot, theme, language, and insight to a
greater extent than long form fiction.
